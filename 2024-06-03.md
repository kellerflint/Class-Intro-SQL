201 Week 10 Update and Final Exam Reminder

Hey everyone,

Week 10 content has been posted on Canvas. In this last week we'll be talking about more advanced querying techniques using GROUP BY and aggregate functions to help do more meaningful data analytics. The week 10 assignment is due at midnight on Wednesday June 12th.

I've also posted final exam information and a practice final in the "Final Exam" module on Canvas. I would HIGHLY recommend that everyone take the practice final without relying on notes or checking answers until you're done. The questions on the practice final are very close to what you will see on the final exam. If there is anything you don't understand I'd suggest reviewing the material or stopping by the tutors or my office hours to get help.

Remember that the final exam is in-person and required for this course! It will be held on **Monday June 17th from 12:00-2:00pm** PST at the Auburn Center in room AC 310 (1221 D St NE, Auburn, WA 98002). This is NOT on Green River's main campus, it is at the Auburn Center campus. Make sure you will be able to get there on the exam day.

If you cannot attend the final exam at that time you MUST get in contact with me as soon as possible (by June 10th at the absolute latest) to make other arrangements. Please email me at kflint-blanchard@greenriver.edu if you require a different exam time.

Don't forget to complete the week 9 assignment that is due on Wednesday June 5th at midnight. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to get in touch or stop by office hours. Have a great week!

Hey Everyone,

We're in the home stretch now! There's no new materials or lessons for this week. Please use this time to prepare for the final exam.
