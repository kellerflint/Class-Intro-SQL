Last, we'll understand how to sort our data using the ORDER BY clause.\n\nAs you progress through the lessons, make sure to solve the practice questions in your own database.

We'll do this by running a SQL script. Follow these steps to execute the script on your database:\n\n1. **Download and Open the SQL File**:\n    - Download the script file [[CustomerScript.sql]]. It contains the commands to create tables and insert data into them. It can be opened with any text or code editor. I'd recommend [Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined](https://code.visualstudio.com/) but you can use whatever software you'd like.\n2. **Access phpMyAdmin**:\n    - From your WebHostingForStudents Client Area (https://webhostingforstudents.com/accounts/clientarea.php), find your website and click the \"Log in to cPanel\" button.\n    - Once in cPanel, click \"phpMyAdmin\" under the \"Databases\" section.\n1. **Connect to Your Database**:\n    - Make sure you're connected to the correct database where you want to run the script. In this case, it will be the database you created for this class. In phpMyAdmin you can do this by clicking on the database name on the left side of the screen.\n2. **Run the Script**:\n    - To run SQL code, click the \"SQL\" tab in the horizontal menu at the top of the screen.\n    - Copy over the entire contents of the SQL script into the editor. \n    - Click the \"Go\" button at the bottom right. This will create tables and populate them with data.\n1. **Verify the Data**:\n    - After running the script, check to ensure that tables are created and data is inserted. You can do this by running a simple SELECT query, like `SELECT * FROM tablename;`.\n\nBack: [[Select and Filter Data - Introduction]] | Next: [[Select and Filter Data - SELECT Statement]] ","lastmodified":"2024-01-08T20:51:46.77971059Z","tags":[]},"/Select-and-Filter-Data/Select-and-Filter-Data-SELECT-Statement":{"title":"Select and Filter Data - SELECT Statement","content":"# Lesson\n## Database Basics\n\nDatabases exist to help us store and manage large amounts of information in an organized way. In SQL this data is organized into tables consisting of rows and columns. Each table in a database represents a different entity, such as customers, products, or orders. The rows in the table represent individual records, and the columns represent the attributes of these entities.\n##### Example Table: Customers\n| CustomerID | FirstName | LastName | Email               |\n|------------|-----------|----------|---------------------|\n| 1          | John      | Doe      | johndoe@email.com   |\n| 2          | Jane      | Smith    | janesmith@email.com |\n| 3          | Alex      | Johnson  | alexj@email.com     |\n\n## Introduction to the SELECT Statement\nThe `SELECT` statement is used to retrieve data from a database. It allows you to specify exactly which data you want to fetch from a table.\n\n##### Basic SELECT Syntax\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, ...\nFROM table_name;\n```\n\n##### Selecting Specific Columns\nTo retrieve specific columns from a table, list the column names separated by commas. For example the query:\n\n```sql\nSELECT FirstName, LastName\nFROM Customers;\n```\n\nWill result in the following output:\n\n| FirstName | LastName |\n| ---- | ---- |\n| John | Doe |\n| Jane | Smith |\n| Alex | Johnson |\n##### Selecting All Columns\nTo select all columns from a table, use the asterisk `*` symbol:\n```sql\nSELECT *\nFROM Customers;\n```\n\nThis query will result in the entire Customers table being displayed.\n\n# Practice\n\n\n\nBack: [[Select and Filter Data - Running Database Scripts]] | Next: ","lastmodified":"2024-01-08T20:51:46.77971059Z","tags":[]},"/Test-Page":{"title":"Test Page","content":"[[Select and Filter Data - Introduction]]\n\nsome text\n\n\u003ciframe src=\"https://egator.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=3e71f26b-d2a9-42d7-af8c-b0f10136ffe6\u0026autoplay=false\u0026offerviewer=true\u0026showtitle=true\u0026showbrand=true\u0026captions=false\u0026interactivity=all\" height=\"405\" width=\"720\" style=\"border: 1px solid #464646;\" allowfullscreen allow=\"autoplay\" aria-label=\"Panopto Embedded Video Player\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\nLet's find out if this work","lastmodified":"2024-01-08T20:51:46.77971059Z","tags":[]}}
