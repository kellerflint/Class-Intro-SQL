# W7 Assignment

**Instructions**:
1. Choose a topic or skill you'd like to learn about that you're not very familiar with. It should be conceptual, not just factual. A few examples might be k-means clustering or another unsupervised learning technique we did not cover in class, a deeper dive into neural network architectures like CNNs, RNNs or Transformers, or any other concepts that may be somewhat challenging and outside of your expertise.
2. Find an online resource, such as an article or tutorial, that provides a base for learning the topic.
3. Use an AI language model (recommended: Claude Sonnet for strong reasoning, Gemini for access to internet and more up-to-date knowledge, or another if you have access) to assist in your learning process. When you encounter difficulties, ask the AI to:
    - Simplify the topic
    - Explain a concept
    - Provide an example
4. Test your understanding by rephrasing the content in your own words and asking the AI to verify the correctness of your understanding.
5. Confirm your learning by re-reading the original source or finding a new source through a Google search. Ensure that what you learned aligns with your understanding from the AI interactions. 
6. I will often repeat this cycle several times to get deeper engagement with the topic, but only one iteration is required for this assignment.

**Submission Requirements**:
1. At the top of your submission, provide links to the sources you used during the learning process.
2. Include at least two back-and-forth interaction with the AI that you found useful or not useful. Copy the prompt you provided and the AI's response for these interactions.
3. Briefly explain what about the selected interactions were useful or not useful for your learning.
4. Summarize your overall experience using the AI, addressing the following questions:
    - How did the learning process go for you?
    - Did you discover any tricks for effectively using the AI?
    - Would you use AI for learning in the future?
5. Export as a PDF and submit to the assignment on Canvas.
