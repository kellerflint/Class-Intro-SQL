## Subject: Capstone Project Introduction – [Project Title]

Dear [Client's Name],

We hope you’re doing well! After reviewing proposals, we chose your submission **[Project Title]** for our capstone project and would like to set up an initial meeting to learn more about your goals and requirements.
### Who We Are

We are a team of [X] students from Green River's Software Development program working on this project to gain real-world development experience. Our goal is to build something valuable for you while applying and refining our skills.

### Next Steps: Initial Meeting

To ensure a productive partnership, we'd like to schedule a meeting to:

- Introduce our team and establish a point of contact.
- Clarify your key project requirements and priorities.
- Discuss deliverables, feasibility, and any constraints.
- Align on expectations for communication and bi-weekly meetings to review work.

### What to Expect from Us

- We are students working on this part-time (approximately 5-10 hours per week per person). While we’ll strive to build something useful, we may not be able to implement every feature.
- We will start by assessing the project's feasibility to ensure it’s a good fit for our skills and scope. If challenges arise, we’ll discuss possible adjustments with you.
- We plan to keep our instructors (Tina Ostrander and Keller Flint) CC’d on emails for visibility and support. You are welcome to reach out to them directly if you have any concerns.

### Scheduling a Meeting

Let us know your availability for an initial discussion. [Note meeting restriction / expectations like virtual vs in-person or times the team is available]. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly.

We’re looking forward to working with you!

Best,
[Your Name]
