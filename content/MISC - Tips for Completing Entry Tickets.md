**Be Concise:** Provide brief answers that get straight to the point.

**Be Specific:** Use precise language and relevant examples. Avoid vague meaningless statements that are not necessary to answer the question.

**Manage Your Time:** Don't spend more than 2-3 minutes on each question. You can come back if you have extra time.

**Remember:** If you understand the material, conveying your thoughts shouldn’t take long. Show your comprehension efficiently!

### Example

**Question:** 

Briefly describe the difference between Decision Trees and Random Forests. Why might you choose Random Forests over Decision Trees?

**Response:** 

Decision Trees are single tree-based models whereas Random Forests consist of multiple Decision Trees trained on different data subsets. By combining multiple trees, Random Forests reduce the risk of overfitting, increase accuracy, and reduce the model's sensitivity to noise.
