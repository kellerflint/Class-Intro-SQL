# AI Workflow Orchestration

LLMs are often used to answer a single question at a time, but that’s not the only way they can be used. Humans don’t solve problems in a single step; we follow processes, react to observations, and refine our thinking through multiple passes. LLMs can do this too.

The free course (linked below) by Andrew Ng introduces how to use LLM frameworks to accomplish this. LLM frameworks tools can make it easier to work with LLMs in complex applications by handling common functionality and error management for you. Using a framework like LangChain isn’t mandatory, but they can be helpful depending on your needs. 

Take the time to at least watch through the videos. They’ll give you a solid foundation for automating more complex tasks and building powerful LLM-powered applications.
