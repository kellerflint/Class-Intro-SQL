# Final Project Peer Reviews

The goal is to provide constructive feedback to a partner about their project while also receiving feedback on your own. To prepare for this, follow these steps:

**Bring Your Project Resources:** Come to class ready to walk your partner through your project. Ensure all relevant materials, resources, and any ongoing work are accessible for review.

**Engage in Discussion:** During the session, take turns presenting your projects. Explain your progress, objectives, challenges, and any specific areas where feedback is welcome.

**Write a Review:** After your partner presents their project, write a short review covering the following:
- **Strengths:** Highlight what is working well or particularly impressive.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Identify any issues or areas that could be clarified or improved.
- **Suggestions:** Offer actionable feedback or ideas to help your partner move forward.

Your review does not need to be extensive but should consist of a few paragraphs capturing your honest thoughts and observations.

**Submit Your Feedback:** At the end of the session, exchange your written feedback with your partner. This ensures both parties leave with clear and actionable input.

Remember, the focus is on being constructive and supportive. Come prepared, stay engaged, and help each other out!
