# Final Project Peer Reviews

The goal is to provide constructive feedback to a partner about their project while also receiving feedback on your own. To prepare for this, follow these steps:

**Bring Your Project Resources:** Come to class ready to walk your partner through your project. Ensure all relevant materials, resources, and any ongoing work are accessible for review.

**Engage in Discussion:** During the session, take turns presenting your projects. Explain your progress, objectives, challenges, and any specific areas where feedback is welcome.

**Write a Review:** After both you and your partner present your project, your will each write up a short review covering the following:
- **Strengths:** Highlight what is working well or particularly impressive.
- **Areas for Improvement:** Identify any issues or areas that could be clarified or improved.
- **Suggestions:** Offer actionable feedback or ideas to help your partner move forward.

Your review does not need to be extensive but should consist of a few paragraphs capturing your honest thoughts and observations.

**Submit Your Feedback:** At the end of the session, exchange the written feedback with your partner to ensures both parties leave with clear and actionable input.
- Make sure to also submit this feedback in Canvas so I can see your comments. Please include the name of your partner.

Remember, the focus is on being constructive and supportive. Come prepared, stay engaged, and help each other out!
