This assignment is divided into three sections, each aimed at developing a different aspect of your querying and analytical skills.

It is **ESSENTIAL** that you start project assignments early so you have time to get help!
# Section 1: Understand the Data Structure

In this section, you will familiarize yourself with the structure of our sample HR database. Your tasks will involve writing SQL queries to explore the contents of each tables. You will:
- Retrieve and observe data from single tables.
- Use WHERE clauses to filter data based on specific conditions.
- Apply ORDER BY to sort data and make your result sets more readable.

# Section 2: Construct Relational Queries

This section is designed to make you think about how to retrieve meaningful information from multiple tables to answer a question. You will:
- Use SELECT statements to gather data across related tables.
- Employ logical and comparison operators to refine your search criteria.
- Perform table joins to consolidate data from different sources.

# Section 3: Perform Data Analysis

This final section of this assignment moves beyond the syntax of SQL and requires you to start thinking like a data analyst. You will:
- Write queries to answer high-level questions.
- Analyze query results to identify patterns.
- Compare and contrast data to draw conclusions using your best judgement.
