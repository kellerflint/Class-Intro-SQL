### Structure
1. Before your timeslot, prepare your development environment:
	- Launch Visual Studio Code
	- Create a new file called `midterm.js` and add `console.log('Hello, world!');`
	- Open the terminal and run `node midterm.js` to ensure everything is up and running. You should see the output `Hello, world!` in your terminal.
2. Join the meeting a few minutes early in case of any connection or technical issues.
3. Join my office hours on Zoom at the scheduled time:

### Grading
50% of your grade is awarded for showing up at your scheduled time and making a good faith effort to answer questions. The remaining 50% will be based on how far you are able to get in completing a few technical questions.

**The midterm is CLOSED NOTES!** Like a real technical interview, the use of external tools (Google, AI, Notes, etc.) is not permitted.

### Topics Covered
You will want to know how to:
- Assign variables
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide variables
- Use the modulus operator
- Check for equality
- Use `for` and `while` loops
- Write functions that returns values
- Call functions
- Create arrays (empty and with starting values)
- Access elements in an array or string
- Find the length of an array or string
- Add and remove items from an array
- Use `if` `else if` and `else` for conditional logic

### How to Prepare
1. Try to do the midterm practice questions (TODO) without notes. Questions on the midterm will be similar to these. 
2. Ensure you are comfortable with the topics listed above.
3. If you have questions or want additional practice, seek support before the midterm:
