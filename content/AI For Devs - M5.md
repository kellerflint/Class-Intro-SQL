I think I want to do of m5 is

- MSE for Linear Regression. So we aren't eyeballing things
- Logistic Regression and accuracy
- Train vs Test
- Decision trees

Then m6 would be
- Overfitting and under-fitting. Visualizing it
- Random forests. Boosting vs bagging approaches
- Understanding prediction accuracy and limitations of it. Confusion matrixes
	- Do in class of models that perform well but only because of majority class
