A local veterinary clinic wants to digitize their records and efficiently store information about pet owners and their pets. They currently have all their data in a single table, as shown below:

| Owner First Name | Owner Last Name | Owner Age | Owner Address   | Pet Name | Pet Type | Pet Age |
| ---------------- | --------------- | --------- | --------------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| Olivia           | Smith           | 23        | 1121 1st ST E   | Rover    | Dog      | 3       |
| Greg             | Steel           | 31        | 4939 88th Ave N | Luna     | Cat      | 6       |
| Olivia           | Smith           | 23        | 1121 1st ST E   | Joe      | Fish     | 2       |

7. Explain why the current structure is inefficient. Why is this inefficiency a concern for a database?
8. Propose a new structure using multiple relational tables without losing the ability to look up which pets belong to which owners. Be specific about what columns belong in each table and how this improves efficiency. Identify the primary key and foreign key columns in your new structure. *(It may help to use a tool like excel, google sheets, or paper to sketch out your new table design before trying to describe it).*
