# Week 7 Learning Objectives
*These topics are what will be covered in this week's knowledge check and entry ticket quiz.*
- Understand the concept of generative AI and how it relies on deep learning.
- Describe the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) as a category of generative AI.
- Understand the basic process of how LLMs produce text using the attention mechanism.
- Identify common strengths and weaknesses of LLMs.
- Explore popular web interfaces for interacting with LLMs, such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
- Compare the performance of different LLMs based on factors such as quality, speed, and price.
- Understand the concept of prompt engineering and its role in improving LLM performance for specific use cases.
- Understand and apply the three fundamental elements of successful prompt engineering: clarity, context, and scope.

**NOTE: Only my first two videos will be covered on the Entry Ticket for W7!** The "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" videos and my "Learning with Generative AI" video will not appear on the entry ticket or be required for the week 7 discussion post.
