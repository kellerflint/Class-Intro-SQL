TODO:
- Video on Canvas explaining this weeks lessons
- LinkedIn Learning videos
- Link obsidian in canvas
- Add videos for each section (except last two probably don't need it. But do one for how to submit the assignment, include creating .sql file in vs code).
- Add quiz. Maybe remove stupid questions though. Or make them just a single fill in the blank instead of multiple.


Didn't cover unique either, need to do that later.

Should be in a handling null's section somewhere. 
- `IS NULL`: Returns true if a value is NULL.
- `IS NOT NULL`: Returns true if a value is not NULL.
Technically these are comparison operators I believe but I don't want to deal with them in week 2.
