Things I missed and stuff that needs to be fixed on the next pass:
- Didn't cover unique
- Should be in a handling null's section somewhere. 
	- What `NULL` is and what it means
	- `IS NULL`: Returns true if a value is NULL.
	- `IS NOT NULL`: Returns true if a value is not NULL.
- We've covered DROP but not DROP IF EXISITS. Make sure to do that when we start creating our own databases.
