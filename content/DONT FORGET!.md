Things I missed and stuff that needs to be fixed on the next pass:
- I need to cover dealing with dates in particular with comparitors. I also need to talk a little bit about data types and when you use single vs double quotes.
- Didn't cover unique
- Should be in a handling null's section somewhere. 
	- What `NULL` is and what it means. Data missing vs intentional.
	- `IS NULL`: Returns true if a value is NULL.
	- `IS NOT NULL`: Returns true if a value is not NULL.
- We've covered DROP but not DROP IF EXISITS. Make sure to do that when we start creating our own databases.
