Didn't cover unique either, need to do that later.

Should be in a handling null's section somewhere. 
- `IS NULL`: Returns true if a value is NULL.
- `IS NOT NULL`: Returns true if a value is not NULL.
Technically these are comparison operators I believe but I don't want to deal with them in week 2.
