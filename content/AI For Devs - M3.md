# M3 - AI Driven Applications

This is where we post the pathways and basically they need to use the week and the discussion to come up with a few project ideas and find data and such. This week is just about giving them the info they need to pick their pathway and project. Might show some examples, link the two pathways, let them choose.

## Learning Objectives
*These topics are what will be covered in knowledge checks and entry ticket quizzes.*
