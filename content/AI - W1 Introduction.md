# Learning Objectives
*These topics are what will be covered in this week's knowledge check and entry ticket quiz.*
- Understand the course structure, expectations and requirements.
- Define Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) in your own words.
- Explain (at a high level, no need to memorize dates) the eras of AI, what enabled neural networks and deep learning techniques in the last 15 years, and the "black box" and "bias" problems in ML models.
- Understand how Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Neural Networks, Deep Learning, and Generative AI relate to each other.
- Understand the types of common tasks in AI (no need to memorize the techniques, just make sure to understand the task categories and kinds of data / scenarios they deal with).
- Understand the differences in approach between Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Evolutionary Learning.
- Explore the current landscape and opportunities in AI and the expected impact of AI on jobs (resources for these are included in this week's discussion post assignment).
