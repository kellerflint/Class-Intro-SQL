# Final Project Assignment

For your final project in this course, you have the opportunity to dive into an AI topic that interests you. Much like your work in the capstone, these projects are open ended and likely to include elements we haven't covered deeply in class. You are expected to do some of your own research and make good use of tools and resources (such as google, online tutorials and generative AI) to assist you. Feel free to contact me if you're having trouble figuring out where to start!

There are several broad categories of project I'd encourage you to choose from:
1. Statistical Model:
    - Select a dataset (I'd suggest starting with [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) but you are welcome to look elsewhere) and perform data cleaning and preparation.
    - Discuss and / or correct any biases that may be present in the data.
    - Develop a statistical / traditional model to analyze the data.
    - Create informative metrics and visuals to evaluate the model's performance.
    - Provide insights into what the model learned from the data.
    - Present your work in a well-documented notebook that clearly explains your processes and conclusions.
    - Potential areas to explore: feature selection, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation, regularization techniques, handling imbalanced data, and more. You don't need to use all of these, but pick a few techniques to implement in your project.
2. Reinforcement Learning Task:
    - Choose a reinforcement learning environment from the gym library (beyond CartPole). [Classic Control](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/), [Box2D](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/) may be good options or pick another environment that seems interesting to you.
    - Implement a solution to solve the selected task. Use metrics and visuals to show your model's performance against an agent taking random actions.
    - Document your work in a notebook that walks through each step of your code and explains your approach to solving the problem.
    - Discuss the challenges you encountered and the strategies you employed to overcome them.
    - Analyze the performance of your reinforcement learning agent and provide insights into its learning process.
3. AI-Powered Application:
    - Create an application that significantly incorporates an LLM or other AI components using the Langchain framework.
    - Utilize chains, tools, agents, and / or memory in Langchain to enhance the functionality and interactivity of your application.
    - Leverage AI to generate comprehensive documentation for your code. Develop a high-quality README file that clearly and concisely explains the components of your project and highlights the areas where AI is utilized.
    - Demonstrate the practical application and benefits of integrating AI into your project.
4. Open-Ended Project:
    - If you have a unique project idea that doesn't fit within the above categories, feel free to propose it.
    - Discuss your project idea with me to ensure it aligns with the course objectives and requirements.

Deliverables:
1. Code and Technical Documentation:
    - Submit your project code either as a well-documented notebook or as a GitHub repository.
    - For notebooks, include detailed markdown explanations alongside your code.
    - For GitHub repositories, create a comprehensive README file that serves as the technical documentation for your project.
    - Collaborate with AI to ensure high-quality documentation that clearly explains your project's purpose, functionality, and implementation details.
2. Presentation and Slides (5-8 minutes):
    - During finals week you will present out on your project and what you learned.
	- You may include a BRIEF technical demo but the focus should be on presenting and explaining the work you did to a semi-technical audience at a high level. Your classmates and I have some background in AI but not the specifics of the approaches you took or the problem you solved. Keep this audience in mind.
    - Create engaging and informative presentation slides.
    - Consider leverage AI to help generate concise text and review your content.
    - Create visually appealing slides that effectively communicate your project's key points.

I encourage you to leverage AI throughout your final project. Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o and Llama3-70B are likely to be your best options for powerful models that can be accessed for free. Utilize AI to assist with planning your project, code documentation, writing, and slide creation. Effective use of AI can enable you to focus on the core aspects of your project and enhance the quality of your deliverables. Just be mindful of their limitations and always review and validate the generated content to ensure accuracy and relevance.

If you have any questions or need further guidance, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm looking forward to seeing the projects you create!
