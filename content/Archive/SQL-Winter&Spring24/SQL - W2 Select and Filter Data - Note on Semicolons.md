# Select and Filter Data - Note on Semicolons

### Why use semicolons?

So far we've only been executing a single query at a time but we could run more. A single query does not generally require a semicolon. However when you have multiple SQL statements in a script a semicolon is used to separate each statement. This prevents confusion for SQL about where one statement ends and the next begins.

Using semicolons is considered a best practice even when they are not strictly required and I will be expecting you to use them in your work for this course.
