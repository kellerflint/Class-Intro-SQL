# W8 / W9 Assignment - Final Project Proposals

### Review the Final Project Assignment

[[AI - Final Project Assignment]]

### Create Your Final Project Proposal

To ensure that your final project is on the right track and aligns with the course requirements, you will submit a project proposal. This proposal will outline your chosen project topic, the approach you plan to take, and the expected deliverables. To assist you in creating a comprehensive proposal, you will collaborate with an AI model (GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet) to refine and validate your plan.

Keep the scope of work fairly small and focused. There are only a few weeks left of class so start with an MVP and if you have time, you can expand on it from there.

Proposal Requirements:
1. Project Topic:
    - Clearly state the topic or problem you plan to address in your final project.
2. Project Category:
    - Specify which project category your proposal falls under (Statistical Model, Reinforcement Learning Task, AI-Powered Application, or Open-Ended Project).
    - If you choose an open-ended project, provide a detailed description of your project idea and how it aligns with the course objectives.
3. Approach and Methodology:
    - Describe the approach you plan to take to tackle your chosen project at a high level.
    - Outline the key steps involved in your project.
    - Mention a few specific techniques, algorithms, or tools you might use.
    - If applicable, mention any datasets or resources you will utilize.

AI Collaboration: To ensure that your proposal meets the assignment requirements and covers all necessary aspects, you will work with an AI model (I'd recommend GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet) to refine and validate your plan.

Share your proposal with the AI model and iterate based on its feedback until you have a comprehensive and well-structured plan.

I'd suggest using this prompt before submitting.

```
Please review my project proposal and provide feedback. Check how well my proposal aligns with the following requirements. Check for clarity, concision and completeness in my writing. Give specific areas for improvement, if any.

Proposal Requirements:
*Keep the scope of work fairly small and focused. There are only a few weeks left of class so start with an MVP and if you have time, you can expand on it from there.*
1. Project Topic:
    - Clearly state the topic or problem you plan to address in your final project.
2. Project Category:
    - Specify which project category your proposal falls under (Statistical Model, Reinforcement Learning Task, AI-Powered Application, or Open-Ended Project).
    - If you choose an open-ended project, provide a detailed description of your project idea and how it aligns with the course objectives.
3. Approach and Methodology:
    - Describe the approach you plan to take to tackle your chosen project at a high level.
    - Outline the key steps involved in your project.
    - Mention a few specific techniques, algorithms, or tools you might use.
    - If applicable, mention any datasets or resources you will utilize.

My Proposal:
{YourProposalHere}
```

*You do not have to take every suggestion the AI makes. Remember, you have more context about the task than the AI does and you are ultimately responsible for the work you submit.*

Submission: Submit your final project proposal as a PDF document to the assignment in Canvas. The proposal should be well-organized, clearly written, and free of grammatical or spelling errors.

I will review your proposal and provide feedback to ensure you are on the right track. If necessary, I may request further clarification or suggest modifications to your plan.

If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out!
