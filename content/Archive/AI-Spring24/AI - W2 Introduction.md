# Week 2 Learning Objectives
*These topics are what will be covered in this week's knowledge check and entry ticket quiz.*
- Understand traditional machine learning models and explain the advantages that traditional models can have over neural networks.
- Understand the difference between simple and multiple linear regression.
- Explain how simple and multiple linear regression models make predictions and why they are generally considered to be explainable / interpretable models.
- Explain the steps required to implement a linear regression model in Python using scikit-learn to predict a continuous output variable from input variable(s).
- Interpret the coefficients and intercept of a fitted linear regression model to understand the learned relationship between input and output variables.
- Use Python and Pandas to train models and manipulate data frames (you will not have to write code during quizzes but you may have to explain or interpret what some Python / Pandas code does).
