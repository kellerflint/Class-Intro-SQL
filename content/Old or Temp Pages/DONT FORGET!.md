Things I missed and stuff that needs to be fixed on the next pass:
- I need to cover dealing with dates in particular with comparitors. I also need to talk a little bit about data types and when you use single vs double quotes.
- Didn't cover unique
- Should be in a handling null's section somewhere. 
	- What `NULL` is and what it means. Data missing vs intentional.
	- `IS NULL`: Returns true if a value is NULL.
	- `IS NOT NULL`: Returns true if a value is not NULL.
- We've covered DROP but not DROP IF EXISITS. Make sure to do that when we start creating our own databases.
- LIMIT should have been covered in week 1. Can move it there next time.



Next up / missed for ERDs:
- Cardinality?
- 
- Maybe quick many to many note?
- Self joins (might be a next section topic though)
- Creating ERDs and design?
- Creating tables with FK and PK.
	- Really we should do this in the other order.
		- First do the ERDs
		- Second do the table creates, then you can PK and FK and how to write them.
		- Then go on to talk about design.
		- Then you'd skip the creating tables part of the ERD lesson. It would go more naturally in the creating and populating section anyways.
