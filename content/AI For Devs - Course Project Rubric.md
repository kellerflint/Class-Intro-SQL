# Course Project Rubric

Total Points: 100
1. Project Implementation (40 points)
	- Completeness of project as outlined in proposal
	- Technical complexity and depth
2. Code Quality and Documentation (20 points)
	- Well-organized, readable code with appropriate comments
	- Comprehensive README file explaining project setup and execution
	- Regular GitHub commits (at least once per week) showing consistent progress
3. Analysis and Interpretation (15 points)
	- Thorough analysis of results
	- Clear interpretation and discussion of findings
4. Final Presentation (25 points)
	- Clear and engaging final presentation
	- Visually appealing slides
	- Demo (if included) is well executed, focused and supports the presentation
		- *I do not want to see clicking through pages of an application with no clear plan or commentary. Demos should be prepared and rehearsed ahead of time and free of foreseeable technical issues. You may also prerecord a demo and incorporate short videos of it in your presentation.

For all projects:
- GitHub repository with regular commits (at least once per week with meaningful progress made)
- README file explaining project overview, setup instructions, and how to run the code

### Specific Requirements for Pathways

Machine Learning Data Analytics:
- Clean, well-formatted Jupyter notebook with markdown cells explaining each step and decisions made along the way
- Visualizations of data and model performance
- Comparison of at least two ML models with analysis of their performances
- Discussion of feature importance and its implications
- Future work or areas for improvements

Generative AI Application:
- Functional MVP with clear instructions for setup and use
- Documentation of API integration and any advanced techniques implemented
- Organized project files and clean, readable code with README containing overview of the project structure
- At the end of the README include:
	- Analysis of app's capabilities and limitations 
	- Potential future improvements

Custom projects will be evaluated based on how well they meet the criteria outlined in their proposal, with expectations of similar technical depth and quality as the predefined pathways.
