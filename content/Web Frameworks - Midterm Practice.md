# Technical Interview Practice

These questions are designed to help prepare you for the Technical Interview. Try completing these practice problems without using notes or online resources.

### Questions

*Use loops rather than relying on built-in JS functions such as reverse() or filter() for the following questions. In a real interview this restriction may or may not apply, but it's good practice!*

##### Return the reverse of the string passed to the function.
```js
function reverseString(str) {
    // TODO
}
```
- Write code to test this function.
- What edge cases should you consider?

##### Return the output of the calculation. Supported operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` passed in as a string.
```js
function calculate(num1, operator, num2) {
    // TODO
}
```
- Write code to test this function.
- What edge cases should you consider?

##### Return the number of even numbers in the array
```js
function countEvenNumbers(arr) {
	// TODO
}
```
- Write code to test this function.
- What edge cases should you consider?

##### Return the index of the first occurrence of the element in the array
```js
function findFirstIndex(arr, element) {
    // TODO
}
```
- Write code to test this function.
- What edge cases should you consider?

##### Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to n. 
For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. 
For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". 
For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
```js
function fizzBuzz(n) {
	// TODO
}
```
