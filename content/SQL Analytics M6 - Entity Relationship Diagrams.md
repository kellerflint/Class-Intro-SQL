# Entity Relationship Diagrams

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) are a fundamental part of database design and architecture. They provide a visual representation of the data and how entities within a database relate to each other. Using ERDs can make it much easier to grasp the structure of a database without having to examine each table individually. In this section you will learn to read these diagrams, understand the relationships between tables, and apply this knowledge to create and query tables.
