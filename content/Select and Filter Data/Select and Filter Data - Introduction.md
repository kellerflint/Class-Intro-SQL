In this section, we'll cover key SQL concepts to help you retrieve, filter and sort the information in your databases. We will cover using the SELECT statement to pick out the specific columns we're interested in. We'll learn to filter which rows we get using the WHERE clause and explore more some of the logic that can help us find exactly what we're looking for. Last, we'll understand how to sort our data using the ORDER BY clause.

As you progress through the lessons, make sure to solve the practice questions in your own database. Be sure to save all your queries to a file on your computer. You will need to submit them as part of your weekly assignment.
