### Objective: 

Analyze video game sales data using SQL queries. Answer three main questions and interpret the results.

### Instructions:

- Create a new database and run the following script:
	- [Course-Resources/content/SQL-Files/VideoGameScript.sql at hugo Â· kellerflint/Course-Resources (github.com)](https://github.com/kellerflint/Course-Resources/blob/hugo/content/SQL-Files/VideoGameScript.sql)
- Use only SQL commands covered in class. This ensures peer reviewers can understand your work and tests your ability to solve problems with the tools you've learned so far.
- For each question: 
	1. Write a comment addressing any assumptions you needed to make or sub-questions you identified. 
	2. Write the SQL query (or queries) to answer the question. Format the query output to be clear and readable so the results are easy to understand for someone viewing them.
	3. Add a comment interpreting the results and stating your conclusion.
- There is no one right or wrong answer to most of these. However queries should make good use of the statements we have learned so far `SELECT` `AS` `FROM` `WHERE` `GROUP BY` `HAVING` `ORDER BY` `LIMIT`. Not every query will require all of these to write, but most of these statements should be used at least once in your assignment.
### Questions:

1. Which genre is most popular?
	- *I changes this question because I think it is more difficult than I intended. You are welcome to still answer the old question if you like but you do not need to.*
	- *Original Questions: Which game has sold the most in each genre?*
3. What platforms sell the most copies?
4. Which publishers are most relevant in each region?

### Format: 

Use the following structure in your SQL script for the response to each question:

```sql
/* Question # */

/* 
Comment on assumptions, decisions, or sub-questions
*/

/* SQL query (or queries) here */

/* 
Interpretation of results and conclusion
*/
```

### Submission: 

Submit your SQL file to Canvas with your queries and comments for peer review.

### Peer Review:

After the due date, you will be assigned to review the work of two peers. Peer reviewers will be anonymous to other students but not to the instructor. Reviews should provide professional, clear and constructive feedback in a 2-3 paragraph response. Peer reviewers are expected to clearly identify at least one area they thought could be improved on or an additional consideration the submission could have considered.

Your feedback will be graded separately for it's clarity and relevance.
