This one is working with Gen AI and using it as productivity tool while we wrap up getting people settled with their projects and doing meetings with me.

My 2 cents. Maybe make this the basis of a discussion post?

While LLMs can introduce a new class of automation to various aspects of our lives, I believe that in most respects the advantages and concerns they bring largely align with those of previous technological advancements. Like earlier forms of automation, LLMs are likely to reshape some fields significantly. They make many computer and information-based tasks more accessible to a wider range of people, similar to how website builders like Wix or SquareSpace reduce the need for widespread HTML/CSS knowledge. However, this increased accessibility comes with trade-offs. Using abstracted tools often means having less fine-grained control over processes and implementations. As with previous automation, challenges will arise around oversight, safety, equity, and robustness of systems. It's worth noting though that such questions exist in any sufficiently complex system, whether those systems are composed of machines, humans, or both. It is not a new problem.

LLMs are also redefining our relationship with language and influencing human-machine dynamics. They decrease the technical knowledge required to interact with computers, continuing a trend seen with higher-level programming languages like Python replacing the need for most people to learn lower-level languages like C++. I believe this shift is creating a sort of universal language shared between machines and humans, emphasizing communication over technical skills. Knowing what to ask for and how to ask for it becomes more important, and many human communication skills will likely apply as models learn language from us and how we use it. In the modern world, the effective articulation of problems, needs, and ideas becomes most relevant to productivity.
