# Week 3 Learning Objectives
*These topics are what will be covered in this week's knowledge check and entry ticket quiz.*
- Understand traditional machine learning models and the differences between linear regression, decision trees and random forests.
- Understand the importance of model validation and testing the model's performance on unseen data.
- Explain the concept of mean squared error (MSE) as a metric to evaluate the performance of a model.
- Interpret differences in MSE scores and their implications for model performance.
- Explain the concept of overfitting and why it can be a problem for ML models.
- Implement the train-test split technique using scikit-learn's train_test_split function to divide the dataset into separate training and testing subsets. 
- Train a linear regression model on the training data, and evaluate its performance on the unseen testing data using MSE.
*(You will not have to write code during quizzes but understand the process such that you could explain it or interpret what some Python / Pandas code does).*
