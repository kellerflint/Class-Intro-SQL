### Instructions
1. Find a dataset suitable for multiple linear regression analysis. [Find Open Datasets and Machine Learning Projects | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?sort=votes&tags=13405-Linear+Regression)
2. Select the columns (features) you want to use as predictor variables and the column you want to predict (target variable).
3. Create a multiple linear regression model using the selected columns.
4. Use the model to predict the target variable.
5. Make your Colab notebook accessible to anyone with the link (Share -> General Access -> Change from "Restricted" to "Anyone with the Link" can view)
### Evaluation
- Appropriate selection of dataset and columns for multiple linear regression
- Correct implementation of the multiple linear regression model
- Successful prediction of the target variable using the model
- Clear and well-documented code

### Submission
Submit your assignment by providing a link to your Colab notebook to the assignment in Canvas. If you worked locally, export your document as an HTML or PDF file and upload that file to the assignment Canvas.
