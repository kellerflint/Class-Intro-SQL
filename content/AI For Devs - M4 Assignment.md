# Assignment: Generative AI for Learning

## Overview

In this assignment, you'll explore how generative AI tools can assist in your learning process. You will use AI tools to help you explore and understand new concepts and skills from your chosen pathway and project work. The goal is for you to develop your own strategies for integrating AI into your learning and technical work, understand where these tools can be used effectively, and recognize their limitations.

## Tasks
### Identify Learning Objectives 
List 3-5 specific concepts or skills you aim to learn (I suggest pulling these from the pathway topics).

### AI-Assisted Learning Process
Use generative AI tools to explore these concepts (I would recommend Claude Sonnet or GPT 4o for strong reasoning / code generation but you're welcome to use others if you have access). Pay attention to your interactions, noting particularly effective or ineffective exchanges. You don't need to document every interaction, but keep a few notable examples for your reflection.

### Technical Application
Use AI to assistant in coding or technical problem-solving tasks related to your pathway or project work. Again, note any particularly useful or challenging experiences.

### Reflection and Analysis
Provide 3 distinct examples of AI interactions you found notably effective or ineffective in your learning or problem-solving process. Each example should showcase or highlight a different tasks or aspects using AI (I don't want 3 examples that all show using AI to quiz you on a topic for instance, try out and reflect on multiple tasks / approaches).

For each example:
- Briefly describe the task or question
- Include a short excerpt of the AI's response that supports your point
- Explain why this interaction was particularly effective or ineffective for you
- Identify any strategies you used or reasons why the AI was well-suited (or not) for this task

### Evaluation and Conclusion
Discuss the strengths and limitations of using generative AI for learning as a whole. Describe what you found most effective and useful, what was least effective, and how you plan to use (or not use) AI tools in your future learning and work.

## Deliverable
Submit a short reflective essay covering the above points. Your essay should be approximately 600-1200 words (excluding any quoted AI responses).

Evaluation Criteria:
- Depth of engagement with AI tools for learning
- Quality of reflection on the AI-assisted learning process
- Variety and relevance of examples provided
- Critical analysis of AI's effectiveness as a learning tool
- Clarity and coherence of the essay
