Overall organization might be to have some async content on Tuesdays that they're supposed to have worked through by Thursday. I'll release the next week's content on Fridays so that they have time after the first week to get it done by Thursday.

The idea is that they're coming in on Thursday with the lessons watched and the work already in progress. I'll start each day with something that requires them to have done the work already. Maybe there will be a lessons/practice due on Canvas by Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning. Then the class will be pretty interactive because I will assume they got the content already. My "presentation" will kind of be an overview of the topic but it will mostly just be a framing to have some discussions as a class, get questions answered and do activities. Then the last 30 minutes should be independent or team work where I can come work with people.

Maybe have regular open form office hours during the time on Tuesday - people can drop in, just hang out and work if they like in a breakout room.
# Module 1 - Introduction to AI and Machine Learning
### Week 1 - Introduction to AI
- Class structure stuff. Final projects.
- A bit of history - state of the art, where we are now
- Where everything sits. Machine learning -> Neural Networks -> Deep Learning. Draw some diagrams to show where different technologies, tools and techniques sit so they have a framework for it.
- Techniques like reinforcement, supervised, unsupervised
- Kinds of tasks - classification, generation, etc.
- Maybe a short discussion post. What their experience with AI has been so far. Where they think it's going. Can share this in class too.

### Week 2 - Machine Learning for Data Analytics
- Traditional machine learning models, the OG AI stuff
	- Linear and logistic regression
- Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks, sklearn and quick Python refresher
- Training and validation sets
- Some hands on walk through of linear and/or logistic regression. Get them predicting accuracies.
	- It'd be kind of cool to let them choose the dataset from a list. Just need to make sure it's pretty clean. Maybe offer a few out of the box or let them choose.

### Week 3 - Understanding Model Performance
- How do we know if our models worked?
- Interpreting linear regression, which variables are having strongest impact
- Type I vs Type II errors
- Visualizing model performance
- Basis in data. Over fitting (especially based on unbalanced data sets)
- Maybe evaluate our project from the week prior. Explain our findings.
	- Maybe do a little data cleaning and run the models again.
- Discussion about AI accuracies and ethics. Things that can bias our data.

# Module 2 - Neural Networks and Deep Learning
### Week 4 -  Theory of Neural Networks
- Basics of how they work. Components of them.
- Different types. RNNs vs CNNS, etc.
- *Start talking about final projects*
### Week 5 - Digit Recognition with CNN

### Week 6 - Object Detection / Classification, Sentiment Analysis or Similar

### Week 7 - Generative AI, Text Generation with LSTM. Maybe NLP could fit here??
- How GPT works
- *Pick a final project, come up with proposal this week*

# Module 3 - Working with AI
*Also start of final projects*

### Week 8 - Working with LLMs
- How to work with them generally. How to get best use out of them. Scope of problems they can solve.
- Prompt engineering
- Compare different models (GPT vs Google vs Whatever). Solve problems using different techniques
- Cutting edge techniques like chatting experts (whatever that's called)

### Week 9 - Coding with LLMs
- Impacts of LLMs to look out for in software
- How to write code with them
- Maybe get everyone in on CoPilot, I think it's supposed to be free for students?
- Hook up to an API and do some fun stuff with OpenAI free credits. Write a simple app that incorporates it in some way.

### Week 10 - Stable Diffusion, Image Generation, Multi-Modality 
- How stable diffusion works, how to prompt stable diffusion, some of the terminology (checkpoint Loral, etc.). Some of the tools, how they can be accessed and used. Locally or on cloud/service.
- Go over some new multi-modal tools. Things that can handle video and cool stuff like that. Overview of some of the services and things that are happening.

Finals Week (Week 11): Final Project & Presentations (June 6th is your last in-person days unless we're going to book time during finals. I think that we should book time on the 13th, we can do presentations of their projects then).

Final Project - Use AI tools as much as possible. No holding back, you have full permission to use AI to it's maximum extent, this should allow you to take on more than normal and prepare really nice stuff. I'd like to be impressed.
- Options
	- Can be using statistical model. 
		- They need to do actual data cleaning and prep. Correct for biases. Prepare good metrics and visuals for performance. Show what the model learned.
	- Can be a TenserFlow model that does some AI task.
	- Can be an application that makes significant use of GPT or an LLM.
	- You can propose your own, but most will probably fit within that.
- Should work with AI to create QUALITY technical documentation
- Should work with AI to create QUALITY slides (if I can find a good tool for it)
