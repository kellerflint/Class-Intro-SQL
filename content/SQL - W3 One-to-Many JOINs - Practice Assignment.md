# One-to-Many JOINs - Practice Assignment

5. Write a query to list all orders and the clients who placed them, sorted by the order date.

6. Write a query to list all suppliers and their products, where the supplier's phone number starts with '+14', sorted by the supplier name.

7. Write a query to list all orders placed by the client with the first name 'Amity' in 2021 (i.e. between '2021-01-01' and '2021-12-31'). Include the client first and last name, the order date and the order ID. 
	(*You can compare dates strings just like numbers! For example `WHERE Date > '2021-12-01'` would return only rows where the `Date` was more recent than December 1st, 2021. `BETWEEN` also works with dates*)

8. Write a query to list all orders placed between '2022-01-01' and '2022-12-31' by clients whose accounts were created on or after '2022-01-01', including the order ID, the client's first and last name, the date the order was placed and the date the client's account was created.
